<h1>Context menu</h1>

<p>So called "Context" is the set of operation you can use
for the selected object in the object tree browser.
You can use the alternative access to this menu by
the right mouse button (for right handed mouse).</p>

<p>Not all operations are available for all database
objects.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Create Table...</dt>
<dd><p>Raise a dialog for table creation. You can use two ways to create table here.</p>
<p>
<img src="create_table.png"/>
</p>
<p>First &ndash; as you see in the screenshot &ndash; you can create a table
with mouse and only a few keyboard typing in the "Design" tab. And the second
one by pure SQL statement.
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Database: a combobox with databases attached. Select one and the table
    will be created in this schema.</li>
<li>Table Name: name of new table. It must be given.</li>
<li>Columns: use "Add" and "Remove" buttons to create columns
    for this table. Every column must have a table-unique name,
    chosen data type (prepared combobox), optional NOT NULL
    constraint, and optional DEFAULT value. <b>Consult Sqlite
    documentation for data type, NOT NULL, and DEFAULT handling
    specials, please.</b></li>
<li>Create: press this button to create table. The result of this
    operation is shown in the text area below.</li>
<li>Advanced (SQL) tab: you can write full featured SQL CREATE
    TABLE statement here. A helper template is prepared for you.</li>
</ul>
</p>
</dd>

<dt>Describe Table</dt>
<dd><p>Show database physical information in the result table.</p></dd>

<dt>Alter Table</dt>
<dd><p>Raise a dialog for table changing. This dialog looks quite similar
like that "Create Table" one except a few things:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>If you will change the name then the table will be renamed.</li>
<li>If you add some new columns then these will be appended into the table.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Sqlite ALTER TABLE command is very limited so there is no
DROP COLUMN clause etc. use CREATE AS SELECT instead. (this feature
can be introduced in the next versions of <b>Sqliteman</b>)</p>
</dd>

<dt>Drop Table</dt>
<dd><p>Really drop the table.</p></dd>

<dt>Reindex</dt>
<dd><p>Perform REINDEX command. If is it called against index
there is only this index recreated. If is it called against
the table then all indexes are recreated.</p></dd>

<dt>Create View...</dt>
<dd><p>Raise a dialog for the new view. There is the list
of required properties you should fill:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Database: select a database schema from this combobox.</li>
<li>View Name: required unique (related to the Database) view name.</li>
<li>Select Statement: valid SQL statement. Please do not write any
CREATE or ALTER like commands. Your statement fails if you will do so.</li>
</ul>
</p>
</dd>

<dt>Describe View</dt>
<dd><p>Show database physical information in the result table.</p></dd>

<dt>Alter View...</dt>
<dd><p>A very similar dialog like "Create View". You can change only SQL
statement here.</p></dd>

<dt>Drop View</dt>
<dd><p>Really drop the view.</p></dd>

<dt>Create Index...</dt>
<dd><p>Raise a dialog for the new index. There is the list
of required properties you should fill:</p>
<p><ul>
<li>Index Name: you have to specify a index name.</li>
<li>Unique?: check it if you want to have an unique index.
    Default is not unique.</li>
<li>Use?: check it if you want to have this column contained
    in index.</li>
<li>Asc/Desc: specify the index sort direction. Default is "ASC".</li>
</ul></p>
</dd>

<dt>Describe Index</dt>
<dd><p>Show database physical information in the result table.</p></dd>

<dt>Drop Index</dt>
<dd><p>Really drop the index.</p></dd>

<dt>Detach Database</dt>
<dd><p>Detach the chosen database. The database will be removed from
this session but the file will be saved. You cannot detach the "main"
database.</p></dd>

<dt>Create Trigger...</dt>
<dd><p>Raise a dialog for the new trigger. There is a trigger
template prepared for you. Just modify it to your needs. Then
press the "Create" button and check the result.</p></dd>

<dt>Alter Trigger...</dt>
<dd><p>Raise a similar dialog to the "Create Trigger" one with
current trigger body preset. Sqlite does not support direct
ALTER TRIGGER so there is a DROP and new CREATE performed
after you click the "Alter" button.</p></dd>

<dt>Drop Trigger</dt>
<dd><p>Really drop the trigger.</p></dd>

<dt>Constraint Triggers...</dt>
<dd><p>There is one more unsupported SQL feauture. Sqlite does not
enforce foreign keys and not null constraints. This action
will create a workaround triggers for you. Your SQL DML
statements will be checked against these triggers before their
execution.</p>
<p>There are three kind of constraint triggers &ndash; one for
each I/U/D operations. This tool suggests trigger names but
you can change it in the "Name" widgets.</p>
<p>All triggers will be created after the "Create" click.
Then check the results carefully.</p></dd>
