This directory contains 3rd party Sqlite3 driver.
This code is taken from Nokia Qt4 Opensource edition.

This driver is used internally in Sqliteman due limitations of Nokia's distributed
binaries for MS Windows and Mac OS X -- its drivers are compiled with less features
of Sqlite3 than it's required for this software.
